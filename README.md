# Cemetery-BowmanND
UPDATE: Site is now online at: http://cemeterybowmannd.com/  
Website to search the cemetery for a grave and easily find where it's located.

The design is just an HTML skeleton, pretty much. Just needed something functional for the prototype to show grandpa.

I offered to create this website for my grandfather who has made a Microsoft Access DB which does this and way more, because he was thinking of hiring someone to do it.
I thought "It'd be a good learning experience" so I went ahead and did it myself.

IMPORTANT
In order to actually run the website it needs to be on a server because of the use of fetch() in JavaScript.
You can use Visual Studio Code's "Live Server" extension (which is completely free!) to run the site.
